It also proposes to make it a punishable offence to finance participation in a terrorist organisation, to publicly encourage or recruit others, or to travel abroad for the purpose of committing this offence.\n\"There is a heightened threat of terrorism in Sweden, which must be taken very seriously. The Government is presenting a legislative proposal under which it will be punishable both to participate in and to finance participation in terrorist organisations. This is about tough penalties, and for someone who has led a terrorist organisation, the consequence can be a lifetime prison sentence,\" says Minister for Justice Gunnar Strommer.\nThe proposed scale of penalties is imprisonment for at most four years. If the offence is gross, the proposed scale is imprisonment for at least two and at most eight years. If the perpetrator has led the terrorist organisation, the scale of penalties proposed is imprisonment for a fixed term of at least two and at most eighteen years, or for life. \nEssentially all forms of support to a terrorist organisation, whether material assistance or assistance in the form of participation in activities, maintain and strengthen it and thus its ability to commit terrorist offences.

The Agency should be able to assume that any who do not provide this information have withdrawn their asylum application, meaning that their asylum case would be dismissed.\n\"This is a welcome step in the right direction, but more is needed. In the future, the entire processing time will be spent in special accommodation centres, which will make it more difficult for applicants to undertake undeclared work or abscond, and simplify returns\", says Ludvig Aspling, migration policy spokesperson for the Sweden Democrats.\nAsylum seekers would also be legally required to attend an introduction to Swedish society.

According to the Swedish Psychological Defence Agency, there are no indications that the campaign will cease in the near future. Social services employees are being threatened and, in the worst case scenario, this risks leading to children in Sweden not receiving the social support to which they are entitled. The Government is now taking several measures to counteract the disinformation that is being disseminated.\nRumours and disinformation are being spread, mainly on social media, about Swedish social services kidnapping Muslim children without a legal basis. The Swedish Psychological Defence Agency considers the campaign to be one of the most serious in a long time, that it will not end anytime soon and that long-term measures are needed to counteract disinformation and rumour-spreading. Social services are the backbone of the Swedish welfare system, and their work to protect children and youth from neglect or mistreatment is crucial. The Government is now taking several measures to counteract the disinformation.\n\"This type of disinformation campaign has devastating consequences when social workers can no longer carry out their important work. It affects children who are neglected or mistreated. The Government is therefore proceeding with a series of new measures on several fronts, to push back against disinformation and strengthen social services,\" says Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson.\n\"I'm pleased that the Government has listened to the needs we have raised to respond to threats and violence against people working in the welfare sector, and is now working on several of the measures we proposed,\" says Peter Danielsson, President of the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions.\n\"I want to make it clear that Swedish legislation does not discriminate on the basis of sex or religion. I also want to make it clear that Swedish social services do not kidnap children. Social services are the last-resort safety net of the welfare system. This disinformation campaign is therefore unacceptable, and the Government is taking a strong stand against the disinformation and the spreading of rumours,\" says Minister for Social Services Camilla Waltersson Gronvall.\n\"It is unacceptable that police and social workers, for example, are being subjected to violence, threats, harassment or undue influence because of their profession. By extension, this also constitutes an attack on our society. The Government has therefore taken the decision to give the inquiry more stringent supplementary terms of reference so as to seriously strengthen the protection of public sector employees,\" says Minister for Justice Gunnar Strommer.\nThe Government is tasking the Swedish Psychological Defence Agency with strengthening resilience to malign information influence against social services. The mandate includes coordinating with relevant authorities in other countries that are being targeted with similar influence campaigns. The Agency should also regularly produce in-depth status reports concerning malign information influence, and advise affected actors on strategic communication to respond to identified information influence activities.\nThe National Board of Health and Welfare has previously been tasked with counteracting rumour-spreading and disinformation about social services. The Government is providing an additional SEK 4 million for 2023 and amending the mandate. The National Board of Health and Welfare should now reinforce its efforts through enhanced dialogue with relevant actors, and work for enhanced awareness about the work of social services. It is of the utmost importance that the National Board of Health and Welfare is present and communicates facts where disinformation is disseminated.\nThe Government has adopted supplementary terms of reference for the inquiry on measures to mitigate the vulnerability of public sector employees (Ju2022:02). Under the supplementary terms of reference, the Inquiry is to present legislative proposals that make the penalty for violence or threats against public officials stricter, and introduce a new offence targeting insults towards public officials. The Inquiry is also tasked with presenting legislative proposals to reduce the exposure of public sector employees' names in decisions and other documentation of measures, and stronger protection of personal data concerning public sector employees and their close relatives.\nThe Government has decided to refer a proposal to the Council on Legislation for a new act concerning security officers. The proposal concerns more flexible and increased use of security officers, and security officers should also be granted more powers, including - if certain conditions are met - transporting certain people in custody, destroying confiscated alcohol and conducting body searches to determine people's identity.", "id": "239e58d2fb3d310da569390ae73a5ab3"}

The aim is to ensure that the system of regulated immigration is not abused.\n\"For the sake of the system's legitimacy, it's important that it be made difficult to abuse it and that residence and work permits are withdrawn when there are grounds for doing so. The Government has therefore given the Swedish Migration Agency the mandate to take measures that are permissible within the scope of the existing rules and regulations,\" says Minister for Migration Maria Malmer Stenergard.\nUnder the mandate, the Swedish Migration Agency will develop procedures and create a clear division of responsibility regarding the work on withdrawal of residence and work permits. The Agency will further this work by withdrawing residence permits for higher education studies when there are indications that such permits are being abused. Moreover, the Agency will take suitable measures to strengthen work on withdrawal of permits.\n\"The work being initiated today is an important first step towards responsible migration policy,\" says Sweden Democrats Deputy Party Leader Henrik Vinge.\nThe mandate is based on an agreement between the Sweden Democrats, the Moderate Party, the Christian Democrats and the Liberal Party. Under the mandate, the Swedish Migration Agency will also analyse whether automated systems and other administrative support can be used to a greater extent. Among other things, this will reveal indications that a permit should be withdrawn and facilitate more effective use of information from the Swedish Tax Agency. In addition, the Swedish Migration Agency will analyse the possibility of introducing new methods for regular follow-up of granted residence permits and their withdrawal when necessary.\nThe mandate covers all types of residence permit, regardless of the grounds on which they have been granted, and will be carried out without negatively impacting their processing times.\nA written report is due to be presented to the Ministry of Justice no later than 30 June 2023.", "id": "2deecc7a52113230b3018f8f7f4115b7"}

This sends a clear signal to all actors in society. The proposals now presented by the Cross-Party Committee on Environmental Objectives will most likely become the backbone of Sweden's future climate policy - regardless of the government,\" comments Cross-Party Committee on Environmental Objectives Former Chair Anders Wijkman.\nThe proposal means that Sweden is to have net zero emissions by no later than 2045, of which emissions reduction in Sweden is to account for at least 85 per cent. Two intermediate targets are proposed - 63 per cent reduction by 2030 and 75 per cent reduction by 2040. Flexibility has been built into the targets, in that it will be possible for a maximum of 8 per cent of reductions by 2030 to take place through supplementary measures, for instance emissions credits in other countries or more carbon sinks in forestry or agriculture.\nIn addition, the Committee proposes a goal for emissions reduction in domestic transport of at least 70 per cent by 2030.\nThe goal for the transport sector is ambitious and requires a combination of rapid electrification, a major expansion of climate-smart fuels, transfer of goods transport to railways and shipping, and measures in urban areas to favour public transport, bicycle and pedestrian traffic.\nThe report comprises a number of proposals in areas such as urban planning, housing and construction, agriculture and foodstuffs, industrial policy and management of energy and materials. The Committee also Cross-Party Committee on Environmental Objectives presents proposals concerning increased cooperation between the business sector and the State as an important element of a strategy to reduce emissions from the iron and steel industry, and others. In addition, the Committee highlights the importance of measures for further development of a bio-based economy, in which new bio-based products from forestry, agriculture or aquaculture can replace fossilbased products.\nThe report also contains proposals for a cohesive strategy for a Swedish clean air policy. The proposals in the strategy contribute to development towards improved air quality in urban areas, where the highest levels of air pollution occur. Implementation will lead to a significant reduction of the large socioeconomic costs for medical care, loss of work and premature deaths, which are currently estimated at SEK 30-42 billion per year. The Committee's proposals also reduce the risk of a ruling against Sweden by the Court of Justice of the European Union for exceeding EU limits for particles, which could lead to fines of SEK 30 million to SEK 200 million per year.", "id": "3022393482333199bef29243a992cc87"}

Before that, she worked as a nurse for 15 years, first in Apac and then in Lira. Alongside her work, Rose has been a diligent student. After earning a certificate and a diploma in nursing, she earned a diploma in midwifery, and most recently a diploma in health administration. Rose is an inspiring role model for lifelong learning and her story showcases the enormous benefits of investing in midwifery. \nRose Aciro has a strong commitment to training students. She is passionate about sharing her knowledge and experience with a new generation of midwives for the benefit of mothers, children and families in Lira and beyond. Rose is a strong advocate for maternal and infant health.\nThe Embassy of Sweden in Uganda will soon pay Rose a visit at Lira Regional Referral Hospital to present her with the award and recognise her outstanding contribution to the community that she serves. \nAlthough maternal and infant mortality rates have dropped by half since 1990, about 800 women still die from pregnancy- or childbirth-related complications around the world every day. Of these, 99 per cent are women and girls in developing countries. Nearly 3 million newborns die each year and 2.6 million babies are still-born. \nThe midwives4all award is part of midwives4all.org, a campaign launched by the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs to create engagement and increase international recognition of midwifery skills. Sweden is convinced that supporting midwifery-led care is a smart investment.\nThe Lancet Series on Midwifery points out that two thirds of mothers and newborn babies who die could be saved if a well-trained midwife was present at the birth. \nThe International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) supports, represents and strengthens 119 Midwifery Associations in 106 countries, improving maternal and newborn health and working closely with the World Health Organization, UN agencies, partners and governments.

The proposals aim to create conditions for the continued growth of Sweden's military defence and make preparations for NATO membership. Increased appropriations totalling SEK 660 million are proposed in the Spring Amending Budget for 2023. In addition, it is proposed that the Swedish Armed Forces' authorisation to place orders be increased by SEK 16.78 billion. \nSweden's defence and security are a top priority for the Government. There is a war in Europe, and an armed attack on Sweden cannot be ruled out. The Government is therefore taking action to strengthen Sweden's security. On 17 April, the Government will present the Spring Amending Budget, which includes proposals to strengthen national defence and make preparations for Sweden's membership of NATO.\nThe Government's proposals include measures to strengthen command and control, for instance by increasing the functionality of the Swedish Armed Forces' strategic network and early warning system. These command-and-control measures are being implemented to increase Sweden's joint operational capability nationally and internationally.\nThe Government's Spring Amending Budget also contains measures pertaining to fighter aircraft. After 2030, the JAS 39 C/D will operate in parallel with the JAS 39 E. The JAS 39 C/D therefore needs to be upgraded to remain operationally relevant for the duration of its lifespan. For this to be possible, agreed delivery times and the functional requirements in existing contracts for the JAS 39 E need to be adjusted to reflect the new overall needs. In addition, concept studies of future combat aircraft capabilities will be made possible.\nThe Swedish Armed Forces' increased funding and authorisation to place orders will also facilitate preparations for Sweden's membership of NATO. The preparations include strengthening command support systems that are interoperable with NATO's, infrastructure investments, the purchase of fuel reserves and measures to enable Sweden to join NATO's integrated air and missile defence system.\nMoreover, the Government is providing funds to finance Swedish contributions to NATO.

The Government is now investing SEK 850 million in more renewable energy, more efficient energy use and more energy and climate advisory services in 2018, with additional funding in 2019 and 2020. \nSweden has ambitious goals for energy and climate adaptation. The 2016 energy agreement between the Government, the Moderate Party, the Centre Party and the Christian Democrats sets the target of 50 per cent more efficient energy use by 2030, and 100 per cent renewable energy production by 2040. The Government has adopted a target of net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2045.\n\"The budget contains several major investments that will bring us closer to our goals. The expansion of wind power and solar energy continues, and we also want to make it easier for households and businesses to use energy more efficiently,\" says Minister for Policy Coordination and Energy Ibrahim Baylan.\nThe Budget Bill for 2018 is based on an agreement between the Government and the Left Party. The new investments in the energy budget for 2018 are outlined below.\nTo achieve the goal of 50 per cent more efficient energy use by 2030, measures are needed in this area. The Government is therefore investing SEK 125 million in 2018-2020 in a new programme for energy efficiency in industry. In addition to the energy efficiency gains that will be made, employment and growth will benefit if businesses can reduce their energy costs and increase their competitiveness. The Government proposes increasing the appropriation by SEK 25 million in 2018. In 2019 and 2020 the appropriation is expected to increase by SEK 40 million and SEK 60 million respectively.\nSolar energy will play an increasingly important role in a future sustainable energy system. There is a great deal of interest in installing solar cells. The Government has made it easier and more worthwhile for households to invest in the production of solar electricity and is now strengthening the appropriation to solar cell support so that more people can take advantage of this. The Government proposes (as previously announced) that funding to solar electricity increase by SEK 203 million in 2017, by SEK 525 million in 2018 and 2019, and by SEK 915 million in 2020, in appropriation 1:7 Energy technologies.\nIt has to be easy to do the right thing - to opt for renewable energy or use energy more efficiently. Municipal energy and climate advisory services are available throughout the country and give households and businesses the opportunity to contribute to solving the challenge of climate change. The Government proposes that state support for municipal energy and climate advisory services be extended and expanded by SEK 125 million in 2018, by SEK 160 million in 2019 and by SEK 200 million in 2020 (appropriation 1:2 Measures for energy efficiency).\nStrategic measures are needed throughout the country to address energy and climate adaptation. The Government is therefore investing in strengthening the resources of public sector actors at regional and local level. One investment will promote more sustainable transport solutions. In addition, information campaigns for children and young people will be conducted.\nThe Government therefore proposes increasing appropriation 1:10 Local and regional capacity development for climate and energy adaptation by SEK 65 million in 2018. The appropriation in 2019 and 2020 is expected to increase by SEK 90 million and SEK 135 million respectively.\nThe expansion of Swedish wind power continues and it is important to achieve the goal of 100 per cent renewable electricity production by 2040. There is good potential for continued expansion in Sweden. The Government therefore proposes new support to municipalities to facilitate the establishment of wind power facilities through an increase of SEK 70 million per year in appropriation 1:5 Planning support for wind power from 2018.\nThe Government sees the need to strengthen total defence in the coming years against the background of security developments in the neighbourhood and events revealing society's vulnerability. The Government proposes that the Swedish Energy Agency receive an additional SEK 10 million per year from 2018 for work to enhance civilian defence in energy supply (appropriations 1:1 Swedish Energy Agency and 1:8 Electricity preparedness).\nTo meet the Government's high level of ambition in global climate action and to contribute to the export strategy, the Government is providing additional resources to the Swedish Energy Agency to send staff on secondments abroad. This will be to countries or international bodies where Sweden needs to increase its local presence, where investments in energy infrastructure and technology are expected to grow most in the coming years, and where the largest greenhouse gas emissions are expected. The Government therefore proposes providing the Swedish Energy Agency with an additional SEK 5 million as of 2018.\nThe Government proposes that the investments of SEK 850 million in 2018 be followed by SEK 920 million in 2019 and SEK 1.5 billion in 2020.", "id": "3d025501b6f03f95b087041c6e3424f1"}

This will result in a new powerful tool to combat terrorism and safeguard our free and open society,\" says Minister for Justice Gunnar Strommer.\nEssentially all forms of support to a terrorist organisation - whether it be material assistance or assistance in the form of participation in activities - maintain and strengthen the organisation and thus its ability to commit terrorist offences. To further improve the possibilities to prevent and combat terrorism, the Government proposes stricter anti-terrorism legislation through the introduction of a specific criminal provision for participation in a terrorist organisation.\nThe proposed scale of penalties is imprisonment for at most four years. If the offence is gross, the proposed scale is imprisonment for at least two and at most eight years. If the perpetrator has led a terrorist organisation, the scale of penalties proposed is imprisonment for a fixed term of at least two and at most eighteen years, or for life.\nThe bill was presented to the Riksdag today. It is proposed that the legislative amendments enter into force on 1 June 2023.", "id": "3dc13fed218b3df883f306e7c07eb079"}

These resolutions have been adopted by consensus and have had broad support from the membership.\nOne result of this was that the investigation was resumed in 2015, having been dormant since 1962.\nMajor progress has been made since then in the investigation. The most important conclusion that the independent investigator (Eminent Person pursuant to General Assembly resolution 71/260) Mohamed Chande Othman, former Chief Justice of Tanzania, has drawn is that it is plausible that an external attack or threat may have caused the crash. Mr Othman has also drawn the conclusion that there is still classified information relevant to the case in intelligence and security service archives, and that the lack of access to all relevant documentation is the greatest obstacle to finally ascertaining what happened.\nBased on Mr Othman's latest report in September 2017 and Secretary-General Guterres's recommendations for the path ahead, Sweden pushed for a resolution this autumn to take on board the investigator's recommendations and stake out the next steps. The resolution was adopted by consensus on 24 December 2017.\nThe resolution extended Mr Othman's mandate and urges Member States and the UN to make all relevant documentation on the matter available and suspend any secrecy provisions or in other ways facilitate access to classified information, as the event occurred more than fifty years ago.\nThe resolution also calls on all relevant Member States to appoint senior independent officials to conduct internal reviews of intelligence, security and defence archives to determine whether further relevant information exists.

It is an expression of honour-related violence and oppression, with the aim of controlling girls' and women's sexuality.\nSince November 2021, the ongoing inquiry has been tasked with determining how protection against this type of inappropriate control of girls' and women's sexuality can be strengthened.\nThe Government and the Sweden Democrats have agreed that virginity testing, virginity certification and hymen reconstruction surgery should be criminalised. The Government has therefore decided to task the inquiry, regardless of its position on the merits of the matter, with presenting proposals to criminalise these acts.\n\"Such tests of girls' and women's sexual activity are unacceptable. It is therefore essential that we are able to take action against people who conduct virginity tests, perform hymen reconstruction surgery or issue virginity certificates,\" says Minister for Justice Gunnar Strommer.\nThe time for the inquiry has been extended and it should submit its final report, together with other components, by 1 July 2023.\nJudge of Appeal and Vice Chair Maria Holcke remains the Inquiry Chair.", "id": "90eedf2529f93689a04516989d9c35cd"}

{"date": "28 September 2016", "title": "\nThe 2015 commission inquiry on The manning system of the Military Workforces presents the Official Report\n", "content": "\nA robust manning system of the military defenceThe manning system of the armed forces is ultimately intended to man all units with an adequate amount of soldiers and personnel that are trained under conditions that make it possible to meet the demands of the Swedish defence and security policy.\n\nThe commission inquiry has - six years after Sweden suspended the conscription system in favour of a recruitment system on voluntary terms - scrutinized the planning of the voluntary recruitment and instead used the outcome of previous yearly recruitments when drafting this report. The Armed Forces assessed the need for 4.000 recruits to undergo basic military training per year in order to man all units of the armed forces 2010-2015. During this period it has been possible to engage an average of 2.500 recruits per year.\nAt the beginning of 2016 the armed forces were missing about the 800 full serving squad leaders, soldiers and sailors and about 6.600 of the partly serving squad leaders, soldiers and sailors it needs. The availability of professional officers will already in 2020 be less numerous than needed. With current yearly intake of an average of 2.500 recruits to undergo basic military training, the reserve of military personnel will almost cease to exist during the next period (2021-2025).\nWhen the legislation regarding the conscription system was made inactive in 2010, the Swedish Parliament made it possible for the government to reactivate the legislation if it was necessary due to a deteriorating security situation or if the supply of personnel to the Swedish total defence no longer can be assured by voluntary recruitments. The Parliamentary Defence Committee brought forward that the Committee expects the government and Military forces to plan for a swift reactivation of basic military training and rehearsal training of individuals who has been conscripts or undergone civilian service.\nThe report has assessed that present the deteriorating security situation and problems connected to the manning of military forces by volunteers is a motive for the government to decide on the reactivation of enrolment and conscription. Enrolment should be made possible from July 1, 2017 and basic military training with compulsory service from January 1, 2018.\nThe military service is gender neutral since 2010. If enrolment and conscription are reactivated, both men and women will have to undergo an entrance assessment made by the Swedish Defence Recruitment Agency. The individuals who is assessed as fit and motivated, is called up for enrolment. The supply of personnel for the military defence system is proposed to maintain the opportunity to apply for admission to enrol on voluntary terms. The total need of personnel should be managed by conscription.\nProposed changes of the current manning system shall, according to the commission directive, be financed by existing budget for the military forces from 2016 till 2020. Related to planning of 4.000 persons ready to start basic military training, and the actual number of 2.500 volunteers, will be below strength in about 1.000 persons in 2017, even compared to calculated demands of 4.000 people. The Report suggests that the surplus budget in 2017 shall finance the added number of 1.000 people up to suggested 5.000 from 2020. During the next period (2021-2025), the Report has calculated the yearly need for personnel to 6.000 in year 2021, and 8.000 yearly from 2022 till 2025. According to the Report, these numbers of yearly additional persons, fitted for basic military training, will form a robust manning of the defence forces. However, this will cause a demand for supplementary budgetary means.\nA reserve of at least 23.000 military trained individuals is proposed. These individuals shall be placed for military service in eventual times of war.\nThe actual average of the full time serving squad leaders, soldiers and sailors stay in service for four years. Contracts can be signed for twelve years. The report suggests an introduction of incentives intended to both recruit motivated individuals to voluntary apply for admission to enrol and to retain personnel. The proposed incentive is related to granting economic support for studies. The economic support is based on the number of years in service. The incentive is further aimed at facilitating a new career after an employment in the Swedish Armed Forces.\nThe report puts forward that military units manned by conscripts can, after necessary political decisions, be put into operation within the framework of the Swedish Declaration of Solidarity provided the operation comprise the defence of Sweden.", "id": "97204cbff6b5312dbfed9ad0556535cb"}

There are also strong links between Turkiye and Sweden. Many people in Sweden are deeply concerned and affected by the events in Turkiye. It was therefore a natural step for the Government to take the initiative to organise this conference,\" says Mr Forssell. ", "id": "a94f5b6822243b649f08c50e9d7f9b06"}

The decision is based on the Government's assessment that there is a serious threat to public order and internal security in Sweden. The current decision on internal border controls expires at midnight tonight.\nIn addition to the human suffering caused by the war, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has created an extremely serious security situation in Europe. Since the Russian mobilisation order, a large number of Russian nationals have left the country and made their way to the EU. The risk of arms smuggling and human trafficking by criminal networks exploiting the war is elevated. In addition, an increased number of migrants are coming to the EU and the Schengen area via the EU Member States that border the Western Balkans. This has placed serious strain on those Member States' reception systems, increasing the risk of large groups moving on within the EU and the Schengen area.\nOverall, the Government considers that there is a serious threat to public order and internal security, and that closer controls of those trying to enter Sweden are therefore necessary. Border controls at the internal borders are the only measure available to tackle this threat.\nThe decision was taken in accordance with EU legislation and is based on the Government's assessment that there is still a serious threat to public order and internal security in Sweden.\nSeveral other Schengen countries, including Germany, Austria, Norway and Denmark, have also temporarily reintroduced internal border controls and, like Sweden, have stated that they intend to continue with the controls as long as a serious threat to public order and internal security remains.\nAs previously, the Swedish Police Authority decides where and how border controls are conducted.

As a result of successful efforts nationally, and initiatives in the EU and internationally, Sweden is now regarded as a world leader in this area.\n\"The issue of antimicrobial resistance is in many ways crucial to ensuring that health care services can continue to provide patients with the care they need even in the future. It's an issue that must be taken very seriously and raised in many contexts. It's not a coincidence, unfortunately, that AMR is sometimes called 'the silent pandemic'. It will be an important issue for us to pursue when Sweden holds the Presidency of the Council of the EU in the first half of next year,\" says Mr Forssmed.\nTo date, two global AMR conferences have been held: in 2014 and 2019, both in the Netherlands. The first conference led to the Global Action Plan on AMR, adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2015. The second conference laid the foundations for a new financing mechanism for the implementation of multi-sectoral actions, primarily at country level.

{"date": "08 November 2022", "title": "Budget Bill for 2023 - reforms to strengthen Sweden in challenging times", "content": "\nThe Government today presented the Budget Bill for 2023 to the Riksdag. Among the proposals contained in the Bill are reforms to support Swedish households and businesses, strengthen welfare, increase security and bolster defence. It also includes measures for increased fossil-free electricity production, reduced emissions and a cleaner environment. The Budget Bill is based on an agreement between the Sweden Democrats, the Moderate Party, the Christian Democrats and the Liberal Party.\n\"Challenging times lie ahead,\" says Minister for Finance Elisabeth Svantesson. \"Sweden is expected to enter into recession in 2023, and inflation is putting pressure on households and businesses. We are facing an acute security crisis, increasingly serious crime and significant welfare needs. Sweden will tackle these challenges with a balanced and responsible fiscal policy and long-term measures.\"\nHouseholds and businesses in Sweden are hard-pressed. The State neither can nor should compensate for all price increases, but households on tight budgets are particularly hard hit and will therefore be given priority.\nDecommissioned electricity production plants in Sweden and the energy crisis in Europe have led to a sharp increase in electricity costs for households and businesses. The budget allocates funds for targeted support to electricity-intensive businesses for their electricity costs. In addition, temporary high-cost protection is set to support affected households and businesses through a difficult winter.\nHigh fuel prices have unreasonable consequences for those who are dependent on petrol or diesel cars. The Government therefore proposes that the tax on petrol and diesel be reduced by the equivalent of one krona per litre at the pump as of next year. In addition, the temporary tax reduction on agricultural diesel will be extended, and there are plans to lower the reduction obligation to the EU's minimum level as of 1 January 2024.\nPeople on low incomes and tight budgets are hardest hit by price increases. The temporary extra allowance for families with children entitled to housing allowance will therefore be extended. Also, funds will be permanently allocated to keep the unemployment insurance benefit at the same high level as during the pandemic.\nThe Government is allocating funds for more places in regional vocational adult education programmes within the framework of municipal adult education, and for more apprenticeships. This is to enable more people to find work and support themselves, and to reduce the risk of entrenched high unemployment. The Government will give priority to reducing tax on labour during the electoral period. As a first step, the earned income tax credit for older people will be strengthened from next year.\nThe current travel deductions are a helpful support for long-distance commuters. The Government will therefore propose a substantially increased car mileage allowance within the existing travel deduction system.\nThe justice system is insufficiently able to combat increasingly serious crime in Sweden. The Government therefore proposes additional allocations to all agencies and authorities across the justice system. Investments will be made in the Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Security Service. The Swedish Prison and Probation Service will be strengthened through increased funding for more detention and prison places.\nTo strengthen crime prevention, the Government proposes, for example, more parental support programmes, increased support to women's and girls' organisations and more investment in sport in socially disadvantaged areas. The Government will also provide funds for an extension of subsidies related to municipalities' costs for the placement of children and young people.\nHealth care waiting times must be shortened, freedom of choice in health care safeguarded, and access to health care increased. The Government is therefore giving priority to new targeted investments in, for example, increased care capacity with more care places throughout the country, maternity care, women's health and older people's health, and to increased central government responsibility for health care, including through a national health referral centre.\nTo increase children's physical activity, improve their physical fitness and reduce sedentary behaviour, it is proposed that a leisure-time card be introduced as financial support to children and young people, especially in socio-economically vulnerable households.\nThe Government also proposes that the general government grants to municipalities and regions be strengthened to reduce the risk of high prices leading to cutbacks, particularly in health care, education and social services, and to negative impacts on employment in the welfare sector.\nKnowledge-based education will be restored. Teachers need better opportunities and more time to focus on teaching. Teachers should also be given more options and tools to respond to disruption in schools. Investments will therefore be made to increase the number of specialist teachers, strengthen catch-up school and improve access to new and high-quality teaching materials.\nThe global security environment requires Sweden's defence forces to be ready to protect Swedish territory. Sweden's resilience needs to increase and military defence needs to be strengthened to enable us to better defend our country, our future allies and Swedish interests. For the same reason, a strong civil defence is essential. Funds will therefore be provided to strengthen both military and civil defence.\nUkraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's aggression is critical to Europe's security. The Government intends to increase military support to Ukraine. Sweden's increased military support to Ukraine should be based on supplying more advanced weapons systems, in accordance with Ukraine's request.\nSweden will pursue an effective and ambitious energy, climate and environmental policy. The Government therefore proposes a number of measures to strengthen Sweden's electricity production, including through investments in solar cells and through electricity and energy efficiency measures in single dwellings.\nTo increase the electrification of the transport sector, investments in charging infrastructure in Sweden are proposed, especially in sparsely populated and economically disadvantaged areas. The Government will also propose a temporary exemption for the taxable benefit for workplace charging of electric vehicles.\nTo achieve negative emissions, the Government will enable large-scale carbon capture using bio-CCS. To reduce emissions and combat environmental degradation, funds will be allocated to restore wetlands and improve marine and water environments.\n ", "id": "bc32fbe17ed532a8bf1603f8cf35c6c0"}

Climate change has a major impact on the African continent, resulting in natural disasters, threatened livelihoods and conflicts. We now have the chance to strengthen the continent's ability to increase efforts for democracy and access to renewable energy,\" says Minister for International Development Cooperation Matilda Ernkrans.\nAfrica's countries and regions face widely differing conditions and opportunities when it comes to sustainable development.

Development cooperation includes support in areas such as environment and climate, democracy and human rights, migration and development, economic integration, and peaceful and inclusive societies.\nSwedish development cooperation will also contribute to strengthening regional initiatives and actors such as the African Union (AU) and regional economic cooperation organisations.

The action plan will contain concrete measures to ensure that effective steps to combat men's violence against women are taken. \nMen's violence against women is a major social problem that violates and limits women's fundamental rights and freedoms. Every year, thousands of girls and women are victims of harassment, violence and sex crimes. Such violence causes great suffering and can have lifelong consequences.\n\"To ensure a coordinated, long-term and effective approach to preventing and combating men's violence against women, the Government will now begin work on a new action plan for 2024-2026,\" says Minister for Gender Equality and Deputy Minister for Employment Paulina Brandberg. \nThe previous Alliance Government appointed several inquiries to look at how to strengthen efforts to combat men's violence against women. Their work has laid the foundations for the current ten-year national strategy designed to prevent and counter men's violence against women. This strategy will be supplemented by an action plan with concrete measures to prevent and combat men's violence against women. The future action plan is for 2024-2026, which covers the remaining period of the ten-year strategy.\nThe Government intends to produce a new national strategy to prevent and combat men's violence against women. As part of the process, the Government will receive input from relevant government agencies, civil society organisations and academia.\nThe Government has already taken several initiatives to counter men's violence against women. In its Budget Bill for 2023, the Government proposes to bolster the work to combat honour-related violence and oppression. This will be done by permanently providing an additional SEK 50 million annually for preventive measures. The Government also proposes to earmark annual government grants of SEK 20 million for women's and girls' organisations in socially disadvantaged areas. This will create the long-term conditions for civil society to combat honour-related violence and oppression.", "id": "c301c7d3c02e3c0a916ffe72c1404cb2"}

The objective of the high-level Conference, which will be open to EU Member States, neighbouring countries, UN members, international financial institutions and other relevant stakeholders, is to coordinate the donors' response and raise resources in support of the early recovery and relief in the affected areas of Turkiye and Syria. The conference will be chaired jointly by Commissioner in charge of Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations, Oliver Varhelyi, and the Swedish Minister for International Development Cooperation and Foreign Trade, Johan Forssell.\n\"We are all shaken by the devastating effects of the earthquakes that have hit Turkiye and Syria this week. The priority now is to work around the clock to save as many lives as possible as many people are still trapped under the rubble, in buildings. For this, the EU's Civil Protection Mechanism was immediately activated and has sent by now 31 search and rescue teams and 5 medical teams from 23 countries.

Sweden's economy is in recession, with the highest inflation in more than 30 years. In light of this, the Government is presenting a Spring Amending Budget aimed at protecting particularly vulnerable households and lowering inflation. The budget is based on an agreement between the Government and the Sweden Democrats.\n\"We are in a very challenging economic environment. Many people are struggling to make ends meet, so it is important for the Government to fight inflation and support those in the most difficult circumstances. In the Spring Amending Budget, we are temporarily increasing the housing allowance for financially vulnerable families with children and are investing in vocational education and training to get more people into work. By investing in defence and crime prevention, we will increase security and safety in Sweden. We face major challenges, but we will get through them together. Step by step, we'll make Sweden even better,\" says Minister for Finance Elisabeth Svantesson.\nWith war raging in its vicinity, strained European energy markets and the country's highest inflation in more than 30 years, Sweden finds itself in an uncertain environment. High inflation leads to a decline in real wages and reduces the value of savings. High indebtedness and a high proportion of mortgages with variable interest rates make Swedish households and businesses particularly sensitive to the rapidly rising interest rates caused by inflation. At the same time, Sweden's unemployment is high compared with that of other European countries.\nFor these reasons, the Government proposes measures in the Spring Amending Budget to protect particularly vulnerable households from rising prices, to get more people into work and to tackle high inflation through increased competition. The Government also sets out a plan for economic policy going forward: the work-first principle will be re-instituted, and structural reforms will be implemented to stimulate growth.\nThe Government intends to address the challenging economic environment by implementing a three-part plan:\nIn addition to efforts to manage the challenging economic environment, the Government intends to continue working in several areas to solve Sweden's long-term societal challenges.\nThe Swedish Security Service will be reinforced to increase safety and security. The Swedish Prison and Probation Service will also receive increased funding to enable it to continue its necessary expansion. Increased support to municipalities for foster home placements is also proposed with the aim of providing places for children and young people within the social care system. In addition to the proposals in the budget, the Government will task the National Board of Health and Welfare with, among other things, developing the knowledge support for foster homes to further strengthen the social care system for children and young people.\nThe Government also proposes increased support for pupils with neuropsychiatric disorders. Higher education institutions will also be given greater opportunity to prepare for enlargement of new shortened teacher training programmes, and the grant to Teach for Sweden for leadership training and coaching of students will increase. At the same time, the Government highlights the need to continue to expand primary care, increase the number of hospital beds and shorten queues for specialist care. \nTo strengthen defence and crisis preparedness, and pave the way for Sweden's rapid accession to NATO, SEK 724 million will be set aside this year.\nLater in the year, the Government will present to the Riksdag a climate action plan to reduce emissions. In the Spring Amending Budget, funding is set aside for forest owners who voluntarily choose to protect their forest.\nThe proposals in the Spring Budget amount to a total of SEK 4 billion.", "id": "d57e41f1a4223e60a6c173aaa3b2a893"}

A concrete example that was recognised was the joint condemnation by the religious leaders in 2017 of violence against women and girls - the first of its kind in the world. \n- It is an honour to receive this award as welcome recognition of the joint efforts for peace and reconciliation by Cypriot religious leaders with the support of the Swedish Government, says Ms Eskidjian Weiderud.\nThe International Religious Freedom Award is being presented for the first time this year. It honours extraordinary advocates of religious freedom from around the world. The awards ceremony will take place in Washington DC today.\nFor more information about the International Religious Freedom Award and the awards ceremony, please visit: International Religious Freedom Award Winners \nThe event will be livestreamed on www.state.gov at 18.00 local time.", "id": "eea9e760bef535c4bbe5b81f4f12713b"}

The Forum brings together decision-makers and key actors from the humanitarian community with the aim of strengthening the EU's role as a humanitarian actor. The Forum will be chaired by Minister for International Development Cooperation and Foreign Trade Johan Forssell.\n\"Sweden is one of the world's largest humanitarian donors and takes global responsibility. Given the serious humanitarian situation around the world, not least following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, more countries need to take their share of responsibility,\" says Mr Forssell.\nDuring the Forum, representatives of donor countries, the UN system, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and civil society will discuss current humanitarian issues and challenges. The aim is to broaden the humanitarian aid resource base globally and in the EU, strengthen the effectiveness of humanitarian aid and reduce humanitarian needs. \nThe Forum is taking place against the backdrop of a serious global situation. Humanitarian needs around the world have nearly tripled since 2019. The UN estimates that 339 million people are in need of humanitarian support this year. There are more than 100 million displaced people, and 50 million people in 45 countries are on the verge of famine.\nHumanitarian needs are growing faster than the funding. To bridge the gap between needs and funding, the humanitarian donor base must be broadened, both in the EU and around the world. In global terms, the ten largest humanitarian donors account for more than 80 per cent of all humanitarian funding. In the EU, five Member States currently account for more than 85 per cent of the Member States' total humanitarian funding.", "id": "f1bc192392d43f6f886643ccf2f7982f"}

It is vital that the Police have the necessary tools to effectively counteract the forces in society that want to instil fear and don't care if innocent people are affected,\" says Minister for Justice Gunnar Strommer.\nTerrorism involves criminal activities of a very serious and system-threatening nature, and is one of the most serious threats to democracy, the free exercise of human rights and economic and social development. It is also found online.\nThe EU regulation in the area, which aims to prevent the spread of terrorist content online, has applied since June 2022. The regulation contains several new legal tools to enable the competent authorities in the EU - in Sweden, the Swedish Police Authority - to counteract terrorist content being disseminated to the public online.\nThe draft legislation referred to the Council on Legislation contains a proposal for an act with provisions to complement the EU regulation. The new act would allow the Swedish Police Authority to impose fines and financial penalties on online hosting service providers that do not meet their obligations under the regulation. One example is if terrorist content is not removed - in such cases, the Swedish Police Authority can decide to impose financial penalties of at least SEK 5 000 and at most SEK 5 million. There are also exceptions for the most serious cases, in which a financial penalty corresponding to four per cent of the provider's total turnover may be imposed.\nIn addition, the legislative proposals also include a provision that would facilitate information exchanges between the Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Security Service. This is to ensure that the Swedish Police Authority has access to the data that may be necessary to assess potential terrorist content.\nIt is proposed that the act, which does not apply to material protected by the Freedom of the Press Act or the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression, enter into force on 1 July 2023.", "id": "f6a753596f68396c964b7dc00f8641f8"}

{"date": "22 December 2022", "title": "Svantesson: Prolonged recession impending", "content": "\nSweden's economy has thus far weathered high interest rates and energy prices better than expected. Next year, however, Sweden will enter a recession that is expected to last until 2025. This is according to the Ministry of Finance's latest economic forecast presented today by Minister for Finance Elisabeth Svantesson. \n- Growth this year has been revised slightly upwards, due in part to companies' continued willingness to invest. But it is clear that a significantly worse economic situation is coming, which will be difficult for many households. The recession is expected to be more prolonged than forecast in the Budget Bill, and it does not appear that it will hit bottom until 2024. Although many households are already facing severe financial difficulties due to the economic situation, it takes time for the increased costs to have a greater impact on consumption, says Minister for Finance Elisabeth Svantesson\nHigh inflation and rapidly rising interest rates are expected to slow economic activity next year. Sweden's economy is also greatly influenced by demand in the rest of the world, which is expected to grow weakly. \nGross domestic product is expected to decrease by 0.7 per cent in 2023, which is a downward adjustment from the previous forecast. Inflation is forecast to remain high for the rest of this year and early 2023 before decreasing over the course of the year. Inflation measured by consumer price index with fixed interest is expected to increase by an average of 6 per cent in 2023.\nDue to the delayed economic downturn, the outlook for 2024 is significantly worse than previously forecast. GDP growth in 2024 has been adjusted downwards to 1 per cent. Unemployment is expected to increase in both 2023 and 2024 before decreasing as demand rises.\nThe forecast is subject to a great deal of uncertainty, particularly in connection with the energy situation in Europe, Russia's war in Ukraine and continued high inflation. \n- In the current situation, it is important that financial policy be carefully considered. The worst-case scenario for households and businesses already facing financial difficulty would be a further increase in inflation. The Government's budget for next year has undergone cuts aimed at combating inflation while providing room to act in the event that the economic downturn is worse than expected, says Minister for Finance Elisabeth Svantesson  \nSweden's public finances are expected to be stronger this year due to continued strong tax revenues.\nThe expected downturn will burden public finances in 2023 and 2024, which will also weaken net lending over the next two years. However, a balance in lending is expected during that time.\nThe level of public indebtedness as a percentage of GDP is expected to remain low and quickly decrease over the forecast period.
